## 00:00 – Hook (30 s)
> “Ever wondered what *actually* happens when you run one line of code—`from_pretrained`—and a 3 GB model just ‘appears’?”

## 00:30 – Learning goals
- Pull a model ✅
- Peek inside config & weights ✅
- Understand cache & resume ✅

## 01:00 – Demo setup
_(Switch to notebook cell 1)_

…

## 11:20 – Take-aways
“`from_pretrained` is just `requests.get` + smart cache management—now you can script, automate, or swap endpoints at will.”

## Your Challenge
“Your challenge: Modify today’s notebook to load a model of your choice. Explore its configuration and weights, then write a short summary of how it differs from the one we used. Share your findings in the course repo to spark a discussion!”
