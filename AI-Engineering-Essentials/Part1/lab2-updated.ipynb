    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's finally dive into the nitty-gritty and see how we can code with Claude.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the Anthropic Claude API, focusing on how to leverage both standard chat capabilities and advanced reasoning features. We'll examine how to structure effective system prompts and create applications that utilize the model's extended thinking capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Set up and configure the Anthropic Claude API\n",
    "- Create tailored system prompts for specific use cases\n",
    "- Compare standard responses with reasoning-enhanced outputs\n",
    "- Analyze the \"thinking\" process in reasoning models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge\n",
    "Take the code we have used in this lecture and see if you can beat my overall score. Let's turn this into a friendly competition for all those tackling this project and compare the results you get :D\n",
    "\n",
    "Place your submission in the community-contributions folder by creating a folder with your name in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Version History\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will find any updates I have made to the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note** that some of the code may be different to what you have seen in the lectures as there may be bug fixes or improvements but the general objective of the notebook will remain the same.\n",

I demand a refund.\"\\n\\nThis is a brief complaint claiming the customer was overcharged and requesting a refund.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s evaluate the response:\\n\\n1. Tone and Empathy\\nThe email begins professionally with acknowledgment of the complaint, but could show more empathy about the overcharging claim. The representative doesn\\'t directly address whether the customer was actually overcharged, which is the core issue.\\n\\n2. Clarity and Accuracy\\nThe email clearly explains the refund policy (14-day window, supervisor approval for >$100). However, it assumes the purchase was made more than 14 days ago without stating this explicitly or confirming it with the customer.\\n\\n3. Problem Resolution\\nThe response immediately jumps to denying the refund without:\\n- Investigating if the customer was actually overcharged as claimed\\n- Checking when the purchase was actually made (simply assuming it\\'s beyond 14 days)\\n- Offering any alternative solutions\\n\\n4. Policy Application\\nThe response cites policy correctly but applies it assuming facts that aren\\'t verified. If the customer was genuinely overcharged (billed more than the advertised price), this might be a billing error rather than a standard refund request, which could warrant different handling.\\n\\n5. Customer-Centricity\\nThe email mentions \"preventing refund abuse\" which could come across as accusatory to a customer who believes they were legitimately overcharged.\\n\\n6. Next Steps\\nNo clear action items are provided beyond \"reach out if you have questions.\" No escalation path is offered for the customer to dispute the decision.\\n\\nDecision Analysis:\\n- The decision (refund or not?): The email denies the refund\\n- Reasoning aligned with company policy: The reasoning cites policy but assumes facts (purchase date) not confirmed in the exchange\\n- Potential risk of customer churn: High - a customer who believes they were overcharged and receives a denial without investigation is likely to be dissatisfied\\n- Communication strategy: The strategy is policy-focused rather than solution-focused\\n- Accuracy: The response may be factually inaccurate if the purchase was within 14 days or if there was an actual billing error\\n\\nOverall, this response is problematic because it:\\n1. Fails to investigate the core claim of being \"overcharged\"\\n2. Makes assumptions about purchase timing without verification\\n3. Jumps to denial without exploring solutions\\n4. May misapply policy if this is a billing error rather than a standard refund request\\n5. Could come across as dismissive of a legitimate complaint', type='thinking'), TextBlock(citations=None, text='# Email Response Evaluation\\n\\n## Overall Assessment\\nThis response is **inadequate** for addressing the customer\\'s complaint about being overcharged. It focuses on refund policy timing rather than investigating the core claim of incorrect pricing.\\n\\n## Detailed Rating\\n\\n**Empathy:** 5/10  \\nAcknowledges concern but doesn\\'t validate the overcharging claim, which is the customer\\'s primary issue.\\n\\n**Problem Resolution:** 3/10  \\nFails to investigate whether the customer was actually overcharged before denying the refund.\\n\\n**Clarity:** 7/10  \\nClearly explains policy but misapplies it to what might be a billing error, not a standard refund.\\n\\n**Accuracy:** 4/10  \\nMakes unverified assumptions about purchase timing without confirming details.\\n\\n**Customer-Centricity:** 3/10  \\nReferences \"refund abuse\" which appears accusatory when responding to a potential billing error.\\n\\n## Recommendation\\n\\n**Decision:** The team should investigate the overcharging claim before deciding on a refund\\n\\n**Reasoning:** If the customer was genuinely overcharged (billed more than advertised), this represents a billing error that may warrant resolution regardless of the standard refund window.\\n\\n**Churn Risk:** Very high - customers who believe they\\'ve been overcharged and receive a policy rejection without investigation are likely to escalate and ultimately leave.\\n\\n**Communication Strategy:** \\n1.
