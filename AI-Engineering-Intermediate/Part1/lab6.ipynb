    "## What are Vector Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector embeddings are numerical representations of text, images, or other data types that capture semantic meaning in a multi-dimensional space. When you input text into an AI system, it gets converted into a vector (a series of numbers) where similar concepts are positioned close to each other in this high-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the words \"dog\" and \"puppy\" would have vectors that are mathematically close to each other, while \"dog\" and \"airplane\" would be farther apart. This allows AI systems to understand relationships and similarities between different pieces of content, making them essential for tasks like search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n",
