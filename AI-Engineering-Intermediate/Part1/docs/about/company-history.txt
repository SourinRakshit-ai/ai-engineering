Sterling & Associates was established in 1995 by Harvard Law graduate Alexandra Sterling. Beginning as a boutique litigation firm, we quickly expanded into corporate law, employment, and real estate. In 2001, we opened our West Coast branch, followed by a technology law division in 2018.
    
Today, we continue to grow and innovate, staying ahead of legal trends and maintaining a top-tier reputation among U.S. law firms.
