    "Our job as AI Engineers is to make sure we are up-to-date with the relevant documentation of the tools we are using. Usually, providers will give ample notice before any major changes are introduced and old methods are depreciated.\n",

    "## Why the Responses API\n",
    "As mentioned in OpenAIs documentation for [Responses vs Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/responses-vs-chat-completions).\n",

    "- Better for agentic workflows\n",
